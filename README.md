🧮 Basic Calculator in C

A simple and interactive command-line calculator built using the C programming language.
It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — and allows you to perform multiple calculations in one run.

⚙️ Features

➕ Addition

➖ Subtraction

✖️ Multiplication

➗ Division

🔁 Option to perform another calculation without restarting the program

💬 Displays results up to two decimal places

🧠 Beginner-friendly, clean, and well-commented C code

🧩 How It Works

The program asks you to enter two numbers.

You choose an operation (+, -, *, /).

The result is displayed.

You can choose to perform another calculation or exit.
